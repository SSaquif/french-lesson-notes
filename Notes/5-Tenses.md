# Tenses

## Passé Composé

> The passé composé is the most important past tense in French.
> It corresponds to the English simple past (I did, I saw …)
> Or sometimes the present perfect (I have done, I have seen …).

- Formed with the present tense of the auxiliary verb "avoir" or "etre" and the past participle of the main verb.
- The past participle of regular verbs is formed by dropping the infinitive ending and adding the appropriate ending.
- The past participle of irregular verbs must be memorized.
