# Pronouns

## Pronoun rules in French:

1. Subject pronouns precede conjugated verbs
   Je = I
   Tu = you
   Il = he
   Elle = she
   On = one
   Nous = we
   Vous = you
   Ils/Elles = they

2. Direct Object Pronouns(DOP) replace nouns that are direct object of the verb

   > Direct object pronouns are used to indicate who or what receives the action of the verb

   | French | English    | Example        | Meaning             |
   | ------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
   | Me     | me         | Il `me` voit   | He sees `me`        |
   | Te     | you        | Il `te` voit   | He sees `you`       |
   | Le     | him/it     | Il `le` voit   | He sees `him/it`    |
   | La     | her/it     | Il `la` voit   | He sees `her/it`    |
   | L'     | him/her/it | Il `l`'ai vu   | He saw `him/her/it` |
   | Nous   | us         | Il `nous` voit | He sees `us`        |
   | Vous   | you        | Il `vous` voit | He sees `you`       |
   | Les    | them       | Il `les` voit  | He sees `them`      |

   More Example:

   - Je `le` vois = I see `him`
   - Je `l`'ai vu = I saw `him`
   - Nous ne `les` avons pas = We don't have `them`

3. Indirect Object Pronouns(IOP) replace nouns that are indirect object of the verb

   > Indirect object pronouns are used to indicate to whom or for whom an action is done

   | French | English    | Example         | Meaning               |
   | ------ | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
   | Me     | to me      | Il `me` parle   | He talks to `me`      |
   | Te     | to you     | Il `te` parle   | He talks to `you`     |
   | Lui    | to him/her | Il `lui` parle  | He talks to `him/her` |
   | Nous   | to us      | Il `nous` parle | He talks to `us`      |
   | Vous   | to you     | Il `vous` parle | He talks to `you`     |
   | Leur   | to them    | Il `leur` parle | He talks to `them`    |

   More Example:

   - Je `lui` parle = I talk to `him/her`
   - Je `leur` parle = I talk to `them`
   - Il ne `me` parle pas = He doesn't talk to `me`
   - Il ne `lui` parle pas = He doesn't talk to `him/her`

4. The direct object `y` replaces a noun that indicated a place (most of the time)
   Y = there

   > `y` is alone in its kind

   Examples:

   - Elle `y` va = She goes `there`
   - J'`y` vais = I'm going `there`
   - J'`y` vais = I'm going `there`

5. The Object Pronoun `en` replaces a noun that was the object of the verb and indicated a quantity
   En = some, any, of it/them

   > `en` is also one of a kind

   Examples:

   - Tu `en` manges beaucoup = you eat a lot of `it`
   - J'`en` veux = I want some
   - J'`en` ai = I have some
   - Nous `en` avons = We have some

6. The `Stress Pronoun` replace nouns that refer to people, after certain prepositions, and for emphasis

   | French | English | Example           | Meaning         |
   | ------ | ------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
   | Moi    | me      | C'est pour `moi`  | It's for `me`   |
   | Toi    | you     | C'est pour `toi`  | It's for `you`  |
   | Lui    | him     | C'est pour `lui`  | It's for `him`  |
   | Elle   | her     | C'est pour `elle` | It's for `her`  |
   | Nous   | us      | C'est pour `nous` | It's for `us`   |
   | Vous   | you     | C'est pour `vous` | It's for `you`  |
   | Eux    | them    | C'est pour `eux`  | It's for `them` |

   More Example:

   - Viens avec `moi` = Come with `me`
   - Parle avec `elle` = Talk with `her`

7. The `Reflexive Pronoun` help conjugate pronomial verbs that express an action done to oneself

   | French | English                | Example            | Meaning                |
   | ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
   | Me     | myself                 | Je `me` lave       | I wash `myself`        |
   | Te     | yourself               | Tu `te` laves      | You wash `yourself`    |
   | Se     | himself/herself/itself | Il `se` lave       | He washes `himself`    |
   | Nous   | ourselves              | Nous `nous` lavons | We wash `ourselves`    |
